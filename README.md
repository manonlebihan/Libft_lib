# Libft_lib
First, second and third 42 project embedded in a Library called Libft. 

## Description
This repository is several projects embedded in one. There is the libft project (basic functions that can be useful in C), the get_next_line project (reads a file line by line) and the ft_printf (a printf function).
Those three project are embedded in one project so that we can install just one library and have all those functions in the same place.

## Installation
To use this project, you need to have a C compiler installed on your computer as well as git.
Then, you need to clone this repository. Once it's done, you need to go into the project folder and type the `make` command.

## How to use
Once it's done, there should be a `libft.a` file, this is the file you'll need to add to your C project to be able to use the library functions.
